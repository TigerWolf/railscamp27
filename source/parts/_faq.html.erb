      <strong>Do I have to sleep in a tent?</strong><br>
      By default, every ticket includes a bed in a shared dorm room. We have gendered dorms, unisex dorms and couples rooms which you can choose from after purchase. There is also a camping space if you so choose, but you need to bring your own tent. Please let us know when purchasing your ticket

      <strong>Will there be internet access at the camp?</strong><br>
      The campground has pockets of 3g depending on your carrier, some of which are inside, which is handy because of rain. It's probably best to assume you won't have internet access and plan accordingly.
