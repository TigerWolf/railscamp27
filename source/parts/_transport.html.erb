    <p>A bus will be at the Adelaide Airport at 3 pm. We recommend you book flights that arrive in Adelaide no later than 2 pm. We will stop in the CBD to pick people up at 3:30 and then travel to the camp. We will stop at a shopping centre and bottle shop on the way for people to buy any snacks and beverages theyâ€™d like (meals are provided though!).</p>
